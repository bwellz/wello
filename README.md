Welcome to Wello Fridge

Live Demo: https://wellofridge.herokuapp.com/

This is a fun project based off of a joking idea on Trello's development board for shoving their product into a refrigerator.

You should be able to get this thing running with just a quick little:

1. npm install
2. bower install
3. grunt

But in order for that to work, you'll need to set these environmental variables:

SESSION_SECRET
TRELLO_KEY
TRELLO_SECRET
GOOGLE_API
OPEN_WEATHER_MAP_API
NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY

And optionally you can set MONGOHQ_URL

Please reach out if you have any questions.
